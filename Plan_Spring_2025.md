# Research Plan: Vision-Based Action Selection for ROS Robot

## 1. Core Research Questions

I'll help you complete the research questions and provide detailed answers. Let me break this down systematically.

### A. Action Selection Architecture

1. Relationship between perception, control, and action selection:
- The system can be represented as a hybrid automaton where:
  - States represent different control modes (exploration, tracking, interaction)
  - Transitions are triggered by perceptual events (object detection, feature identification)
  - Actions are selected based on a combination of current state and perceptual input

2. Mathematical framework for controller transitions:
- Use a discrete event system framework where:
  - Each controller is a continuous dynamical system
  - Transitions between controllers are discrete events
  - Guard conditions are based on perceptual inputs and controller convergence

3. System stability and convergence:
- Use Lyapunov stability analysis for individual controllers
- Employ hybrid system stability theory for controller switching
- Ensure dwell-time conditions between switches to prevent chattering

4. ROS navigation integration:
- move_base provides the low-level control framework
- Higher-level decisions modify goal states and costmaps
- Vision inputs influence path planning through dynamic costmap updates

### B. Controller Design

1. Minimal controller set:
- Position control (move_base)
- Orientation control (visual servoing)
- Object tracking
- Obstacle avoidance
These form a complete basis for the required behaviors.

2. Controller composition:
- Sequential composition: φₖ ∘ φᵢ
- Parallel composition: φₖ || φᵢ
- Priority-based arbitration for conflicting controls

3. Convergence metrics:
- Position error: ||x - x_desired|| < ε
- Orientation error: |θ - θ_desired| < δ
- Tracking error: ||object_pos - camera_center|| < γ

4. Bounded convergence time:
- Use exponential stability guarantees
- Implement timeout-based fallback behaviors
- Monitor convergence rates

5. move_base integration:
- Modify costmap parameters based on task context
- Implement custom recovery behaviors
- Use dynamic reconfigure for parameter adjustment

### C. Perception and Interest

1. Mathematical definition of "interesting":
- Information theory:
  ```
  I(x) = -log(P(x))  // Surprise measure
  H(X) = -Σ P(x)log(P(x))  // Entropy
  ```
- Visual saliency:
  - Contrast measures
  - Feature density
  - Motion detection
- Task relevance:
  - Distance to goal
  - Object classification confidence
  - Historical interaction value

2. Interestingness to action mapping:
   ```python
   action_value = w₁*information_gain + w₂*saliency + w₃*task_relevance
   action = argmax(action_value)
   ```

3. Multi-source integration:
- Bayesian fusion of detection results
- Weighted combination based on confidence scores
- Spatial registration using RTAB-Map as reference

For implementation, I recommend starting with:

1. Implement basic object detection using find_object_2d
2. Add YOLO ROS for more robust detection
3. Develop simple interest measures based on detection confidence
4. Gradually add more sophisticated measures

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these aspects or provide more specific implementation details for any particular component?
