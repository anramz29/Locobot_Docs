# Locobot Documentation

This repository contains comprehensive documentation and resources for setting up and troubleshooting Locobot systems, including Docker configurations, ROS integrations, and development tools like VS Code.

## Repository Structure

- **Docker\_Tips\_and\_Tricks.md**
  Contains tips and tricks for effectively using Docker in Locobot-related workflows.

- **Server\_Documentation.md**
  Documentation for setting up and maintaining server configurations for Locobot operations.

- **Issues.md**
  A list of known issues encountered during the Locobot setup or usage, along with resolutions.

- **Locobot\_Docs/**
  Additional documentation and resources for Locobot.

- **Ros\_Docker/**
  Resources, scripts, and configurations related to using ROS (Robot Operating System) with Docker.

- **VS\_Code\_and\_Docker.md**
  Guidance on integrating Visual Studio Code with Docker for an optimized development experience.

## Future Work

- **Entropy-Based Foraging**

We plan to implement an entropy-based foraging algorithm to optimize the robot's exploration capabilities. This will allow the Locobot to identify and prioritize areas of interest dynamically based on entropy measures in its environment.

- **Computer Vision Algorithm on Remote Server**

We aim to develop and deploy a computer vision algorithm on a remote server. This will be integrated with ROS for real-time processing and decision-making, enhancing the robot's ability to interpret and react to its surroundings.
